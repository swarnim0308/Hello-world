read·Jul 9--ListenShare“Suffering Many Defeats Does Not Make You a Loser 😉”While you are pursuing
success in life and pushing your boundaries to the best of your ability, you will encounter many
failures and setbacks along the way. This is just a part of the process and something that you have
to deal with in order to achieve your dreams.I believe that losers are individuals who accept losing
as a way of life, and their main purpose becomes bringing others down with them. Losers are people
who complain about their life situations but are too lazy to make the necessary changes to improve.
They have given up on themselves. Instead of being happy for others’ success, they become bitter,
jealous, and spiteful.Not everyone will understand your journey. Some people feel threatened by the
success of others. They easily become jealous and are quick to complain about their own
circumstances without taking any action. These people are not winning; they have stopped
growing.Losers often seek companionship and try to convince others to give up on their dreams of
success.When you allow losers into your life, they will take the opportunity to bring you down even
further. Never allow losers into your inner circle of trusted advisors.Losers often become a
constant negative voice in your ear, telling you that you’re not good enough because they themselves
are not good enough.Not everyone will understand why you are so driven. They won’t understand the
long hours you put in or your constant zeal to acquire knowledge and improve yourself.We used to
spend years listening to the negative voices in our lives, and it limited our potential. It hindered
not only our career potential but also our potential to be truly happy in life.Surround yourself
with winners. Once you have eliminated the losers from your life, the next step is to associate with
winners. These are the people who are on a similar journey. Winners add value to your life.They help
pick you up when you fall flat and provide advice on how to do better next time because they have
experienced failure many times and moved forward from it themselves."
